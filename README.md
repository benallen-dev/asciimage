# asciimage

Pass it a png or jpg file and it'll get drawn in your terminal.

Yes, `feh image.png` would be a better idea but sometimes you just need to do things in the terminal.

Update: oh dear I appear to have recreated imgcat.

## Usage

```
asciimage image.png
```

## Installation

```
go install github.com/benallen-dev/asciimage
```

## What's missing?

Tests. This program is basically just glueing a bunch of other stuff together anyway so I'm probably not going to bother, if we're being honest.
